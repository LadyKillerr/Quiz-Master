# Quiz-Master
A short 2D quizizz-like game that was built mainly for educational purposes but I learned a lot

## Things I learned during the making of this game:
- Basic UI Canvas
- Button Layout
- TextMeshPro, TextMeshProUGUI and Legacy Text
- Use Scriptable Objects to store data
- Using Getter and Setter to connect and access other scripts
- Arrays and for-each, for loops in C#
- Sliders to make health bar
- Swapping Sprites and button states
- What is a Game Manager and what it is for
  # And so many, many more yet i haven't listed
